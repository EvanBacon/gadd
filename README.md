<!-- Body -->

```sh
npx gadd <username/repo> --path packages/library

# Example: install React from github.com/facebook/react

npx gadd facebook/create-react-scripts -p packages/react-dev-utils
```

## Why tho

Big epic projects like `react`, `jest`, `babel`, `expo`, etc. keep their packages in a monorepo under the `packages/` directory. These packages cannot be installed directly using NPM or Yarn which makes it awkward and hard to test them without being published. Both NPM and Yarn should probably add first-class support for this feature but they don't üòê So for now you can use `gadd`.

## How

**gadd is** a super light-weight package that clones the GitHub tar to a temporary folder, then extracts the tar into a `.gadd` folder in your project. After that gadd installs the package using your package manager tool of choice!

- Modules are installed in your project's `.gadd/` folder.
- You can add `.gadd/` to your `.gitignore` to keep the dev modules out of your git history.
- Big repos can take a while to install, this is cuz GitHub doesn't support downloading individual folders.
- You can install any repo by ommitting the `--path` arg, but it might make more sense to just install the package directly with NPM.

## Flags

```sh
Usage: gadd <project-root> [options]

Downloads and installs NPM packages from GitHub monorepos

Options:
  -V, --version      output the version number
  -p, --path [name]  The path inside of a GitHub repo where the package lives.
  -d, --dev          Install as a dev dependency
  --use-npm          Use npm to install dependencies. (default when Yarn is not installed)
  --no-install       Skip installing npm packages after extracting.
  -h, --help         output usage information
```
